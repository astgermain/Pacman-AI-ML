Did some cool stuff with classifiers, that, given enough data, could perform tasks such as recognize digit images and learn from pacman agents.
Didn't quite finish question 6.
Had trouble with question 4 in autograder so I ran is seperate using python autograder.py -q q4
Spent about 4 days working on this. Also I will be using two of my remaining late days.
Thank you
